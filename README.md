Toy shell project
## Plans:
* Interpretter
* Pipes
* alias
* disown
* `> file` needs to work
* fix the parser so you don't need spaces between everything
## Credits
Rest: me

# Requirements
* A true colour terminal for proper colours. The prompt cannot be changed unless
you recompile and I'm going to try and make it so you can't change the prompt
from a hot pink colour.
* separate each token with a space. I will not fix this for a while

# Compiling
Compile it with:
```bash
cc src/main.c
```
You can run it only interactively. for now.
```
./a.out
```
